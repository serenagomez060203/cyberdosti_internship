## Project 1: Text Encryption

Text encryption involves transforming plaintext into ciphertext to secure it from unauthorized access. It uses algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA) and keys to encode data, making it unreadable without decryption. It protects sensitive information during storage or transmission.

### To run:

#### Step 1: Install Necessary Python Packages
In the terminal, install Flask and cryptography using pip and set up a virtual environment:

pip install Flask cryptography

python -m venv

#### Step 2: Run the Flask Application

Run the Flask app from the terminal:

python app.py

The application will start running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Open this URL in your web browser to access the text encryption and decryption tool.

## Project 2: Brute Force Password Cracker

A brute force password cracker attempts all possible combinations to guess a password. It iterates through character sets, combinations, or dictionary words to find the correct password. It is used for security testing, password recovery, or malicious hacking if unauthorized.

### To run:

Go to the terminal and type `python app.py`.

## Project 3: Password Generator

A tool that creates strong, random passwords to enhance security. It combines random characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) based on user preferences. It increases password complexity, reducing vulnerability to brute force attacks. It is used in password management tools, account registration, and security best practices.
